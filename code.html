    <h1> FAREWELL GIBSON KIKOKO, FOREVER LOVED<h1>
        <p>Your Departure from this world was a rude shock to us. 
            I vividly remember how a Myriad of thoughts kept streaming through my mind of what I would do and what I would become with your abscence constntly screaming out the inevitable reality.
             </p>
             <p>The lord is not one to be questioned.I believe our separation will not be permanent</p>
             <p> Farewell my dear friend. TILL WE MEET AGAIN</p>
